## PROCESS MEASURES 

### Macro statistics

- 5 stories committed | 5 stories done 
- 12 points committed | 12 points done 
- 96h | 86.25h spent (as a team)


### Detailed statistics

| Story  | # Tasks | Points | Hours est. | Hours actual |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|--------------|
| _#0_   |   8     |        |    56h       |       60.5h    |
| n 9    |   3    |    4    |      4.5h    |       5h     |
| n 11   |   2    |    1    |      2h      |       2h      |
| n 13   |   2    |    2    |      4h      |       5.5h    |
| n 14   |   3    |   3     |      4.5h    |       4.25h     |
| n 26   |   2    |   2     |      6h      |       9h    |

>the sum of actual hours is 86h 15m, check missing hours (there are some tasks with time not tracked)

- Hours per task average, standard deviation (estimate and actual)

  - Hours per Task Average and Standard Deviation:

    - For **Estimated** Hours:
      - Average Estimate: h m
      - Standard Deviation Estimate: h m

    - For **Actual** Hours:
      - Average Actual: h m
      - Standard Deviation Actual: h m

- Total task estimation error ratio: sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent - 1 --> / - 1 = -0.


## QUALITY MEASURES 

- Unit Testing:
  - Total hours estimated --> 3.5h
  - Total hours spent --> 7.5h
  - Nr of automated unit test cases 
  - Coverage (if available)
- E2E testing:
  - Total hours estimated --> 16h
  - Total hours spent --> 16h

- Code review/refactoring 
  - Total hours estimated --> 16h
  - Total hours spent --> 16h

- Technical Debt management:
  - Total hours estimated --> 8h
  - Total hours spent --> 8h
  - Hours estimated for remediation by SonarQube --> h
  - Hours estimated for remediation by SonarQube only for the selected and planned issues --> 6h
  - Hours spent on remediation --> 8h
  - debt ratio (as reported by SonarQube under "Measures-Maintainability") --> 0.5%
  - rating for each quality characteristic reported in SonarQube under "Measures" (namely reliability, security, maintainability)
    - reliability: rating A
    - security: rating A
    - maintainability: rating A  

## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?

  - 
  - 

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?

  > positive
  - 

  > negative
  - 

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve? 
  
  - 

- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?

  - 

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)

  - 

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!
